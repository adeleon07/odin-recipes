    <p1> What is Chimichurri you may be asking? 
        Chimichurri is a loose oil-based condiment used to accompany barbecued meats or churrasco.</p1>
    <p2>It is suggested that you prepare the following ingredients below using the
        <em>mise en place</em> technique to make life much easier.
    </p2>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1/2 cup olive oil
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 cup finely chopped parsley
        </li>
        <li>
            3-4 cloves garlic, finely chopped or minced
        </li>
        <li>
            2 small red chilies, or 1 red chili, deseeded and finely chopped (about 1 tablespoon finely chopped chili)
        </li>
        <li>
            3/4 teaspoon coarse salt
        </li>
        <li>
            pepper, to tase (about 1/2 teaspoon)
        </li>

    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix all ingredients together in a bowl. Allow to sit for 5-10 minutes to release all of the flavours into the oil before using. 
            Ideally, let it sit for more than 2 hours, if time allows.</li>
        <li>Chimichurri can be prepared earlier than needed, 
            and refrigerated for 24 hours, if needed.</li>
        <li>Use to baste meats (chicken or steaks) while grilling or barbecuing. We don't use it as a marinade, but choose to baste our meats with chimichurri instead. However, you can use it as a marinade if you wish. 
            Also, add a couple of tablespoons over your steak to serve.</li>
    </ol>
